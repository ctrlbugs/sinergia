# 🚀 Start Next.js Landing Page

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Make sure you're in the correct directory!

You must be in the `landing-page-nextjs` folder, NOT the `landing-page` folder.

## Quick Start

1. **Open Terminal/PowerShell** in the `landing-page-nextjs` folder:
   ```powershell
   cd landing-page-nextjs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Next.js development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3002
   ```

## What to Expect

- ✅ The server will start on **port 3002**
- ✅ You'll see console output showing: `- Local: http://localhost:3002`
- ✅ The Next.js app will be running (NOT the old HTML version)

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**If you see port 8000 or http-server:**
- The old HTML project has been deleted
- Make sure you're in the `landing-page-nextjs` folder
- Navigate to `landing-page-nextjs` folder first

**If port 3002 is already in use:**
- Stop the other application using port 3002
- Or use: `npm run dev:3000` to use port 3000 instead

## Port Configuration

- **Landing Page (Next.js)**: `http://localhost:3002` ✅
- **User Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Admin Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3001`
